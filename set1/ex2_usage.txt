Usage: substitution [-o] [-d] mapping
Where:
   -o: keep non-letters as is, honor letter casing
   -d: decrypt
   mapping: 26 letter char-mapping
            or an int-value

En/Decrypts stdin to stdout. Only letters are encrypted,
all other characters are silently ignored, unless -o was
specified, in which case they are used as-is.
When -o is specified, letter casing is honored, otherwise all
letters are converted to lower-case letters.
Use an int-value to do a letter shift (% 26, 0: a = a)
Shift 3 is the classical Caesar encryption
