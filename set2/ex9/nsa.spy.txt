The US National Security Agency tapped phone calls involving German chancellor
Angela Merkel and her closest advisers for years and spied on the staff of her
predecessors, according to WikiLeaks.

A report released by the group on Wednesday suggested NSA spying on Merkel and
her staff had gone on far longer and more widely than previously
realised. WikiLeaks said the NSA targeted 125 phone numbers of top German
officials for long-term surveillance .

The release risks renewing tensions between Germany and the US a month after
they sought to put a row over spying behind them, with Barack Obama declaring
in Bavaria that the two nations were “inseparable allies”.

WikiLeaks published what it said were three NSA intercepts of Merkel’s
conversations, and data it said listed telephone numbers for the chancellor,
her aides, her office and even her fax machine.

“The names associated with some of the targets indicate that spying on the
Chancellery predates Angela Merkel as it includes staff of former Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder (in office 1998-2002), and his predecessor Helmut Kohl,”
WikiLeaks added in a statement.

No comment was immediately available from the German government.

The intercepts released on Wednesday detailed communications from Merkel in
2009 regarding the international financial crisis, with the crown prince of
the United Arab Emirates in 2009 on Iran, and with advisers in 2011 on the
eurozone crisis.

The targeted phone numbers included those for the phones of senior officials
at the Chancellery and included that of Ronald Pofalla, Merkel’s former chief
of staff, WikiLeaks said.
